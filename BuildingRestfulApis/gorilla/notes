Mux stands for the multiplexer. Similarly, Gorilla Mux is a multiplexer designed to
multiplex HTTP routes (URLs) to different handlers. Handlers are the functions which can
handle the given requests. Gorilla Mux is a wonderful package for writing beautiful routes
for our web applications and API servers.
Gorilla Mux provides tons of options to control how routing is done to your web
application. It allows a lot of features. Some of them are:
- Path-based matching
- Query-based matching
- Domain-based matching
- Sub-domainbased matching
- Reverse URL generation
