ServeMux is an Http RREQUEST MULTIPLEXER.the HandleFunc is a method of ServeMux. 
A multiplexer just handles the logic of separating routes with a function called ServeHTTP. So if we create a new
struct with the ServeHTTP method, it can do the job

/* Consider a route as a key in a dictionary (map), then the handler as its value. */


// HTTPROUTER
httprouter, as the name suggests, routes the HTTP requests to particular handlers.
Compared to the basic router, it has the following features:
Allows variables in the route paths
It matches the REST methods (GET, POST, PUT, and so on)
No compromising on performance
We are going to discuss these qualities in more detail in the following section. Before that,
there are a few noteworthy points that make httprouter an even better URL router:
httprouter plays well with the inbuilt http.Handler
httprouter explicitly says that a request can only match to one route or none
The router's design encourages building sensible, hierarchical RESTful APIs
You can build efficient static file servers
